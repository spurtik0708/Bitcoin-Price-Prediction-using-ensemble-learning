# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Bitcoin prices using ensemble learning techniques. Bitcoin is a highly volatile cryptocurrency, and accurate price prediction is valuable for traders, investors, and researchers. The project implements and evaluates multiple ensemble learning models to forecast Bitcoin prices based on historical data.

---

## Features
- Utilizes historical Bitcoin price data for analysis.
- Implements ensemble learning techniques, such as:
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost
- Compares model performance using various evaluation metrics.
- Includes preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.
- Provides visualizations for insights into data trends and model predictions.
